                                    break error in the FIFO. It is cleared when reads the LSR
                                    and there are no subsequent errors in the FIFO.
6       TEMT         RO       Transmitter Empty Indicator
                                    TEMT is set when the THR and TSR are both empty. When
                                    either the THR or the TSR contains a data character, TEMT
                                    is cleared. In the FIFO mode, TEMT is set when the
                                    transmitter FIFO and TSR are both empty.

                                    THRE is set when the THR is empty. Indicating that ACE is
                                    ready to accept the new character. In FIFO mode THRE is
                                    set when transmitter FIFO is empty, it is cleared when at
                                    least one byte is written to the transmitter FIFO. In Non-
                                    FIFO mode THRE is set when contents of THR are
                                    transferred into TSR.THRE is cleared concurrent with the
                                    loading of THR by the CPU.
4       BI             RO       Break Interrupt Indicator
                                    When BI is set, it indicates that received data input was held
                                    in the low state for longer than the full transmission time. BI
                                    is cleared every time the CPU reads the contents of the LSR.
                                    In FIFO mode it indicates the BI status of the character on
                                    the top of the FIFO. When BI occurs, only one 0 character is
                                    loaded into the FIFO. The next character transfer is enabled
                                    after SIN goes to the marking state for at least two RCLK
                                    samples, and then receives the next valid start bit.
                                    Full Transmission Time = Start + Data + Parity + Stop bits
3       FE              RO      Framing Error indicator
                                    When FE is set it indicates that received character does not
                                    have a valid stop bit. FE is cleared every time CPU reads the
                                    contents of the LSR. In FIFO mode it indicates the FE status
                                    of the character on top of the FIFO. Under the condition, the
                                    UART will attempt to resynchronize by assuming the
                                    framing error was due to the next start bit, so it samples this
                                    start bit twice and then accepts the input data.
2       PE             RO       Parity Error
                                    When PE is set it indicates that parity of received
                                    character does not Match the parity selected in LCR[4]. PE
                                    is cleared every time the CPU reads the
                                    contents of LSR. In FIFO mode it indicates the parity of the
                                    character on the top of the FIFO.
1       OE            RO       Overrun Error Indicator
                                    When OE is set, it indicates that before the character in the
                                    RBR was read, it was overwritten by the next character
                                    transferred into the register. OE is cleared every time the
                                    CPU reads the contents of the LSR. If the FIFO mode data
                                    continues to fill the FIFO beyond the trigger level, an
                                    overrun error occurs only after the FIFO is full and the next
                                    character has been completely received in the shift register.
                                    An overrun error is indicated to the CPU as soon as it
                                    happens. The character in the shift register is overwritten,
                                    but it is not transferred to the FIFO.

                                    received and transferred into RBR or the FIFO. It is cleared
                                    by reading all data in the FIFO or RBR.

                                    This bit is the complement of DCDn. When the UART is in
                                    the diagnostic test mode(LOOP),this bit is equal to the MCR
                                    bit 3(OUT2).
6       RI         RO         Ring Indicator
                                    This bit is the complement of Rin. When the UART is in
                                    diagnostic test mode, this bit is equal to MCR bit 2(RI).
5       DSR      RO         Data Send Request
                                    This is the inverted version of DSRn. When the UART is in
                                    diagnostic test node, this bit is equal to MCR bit 0(DSR).
4       CTS      RO         Clear To Send
                                    This bit is complement of ctsn. When UART is in diagnostic
                                    test mode, this bit is equal to MCR bit1.
3       DCD     RO          DCDn Changed
                                    This bit is change in data carrier detect indicator. It indicates
                                    that dcdn has changed states since it was last read by the
                                    CPU.
2       TERI    RO          RIn Rising Edge
                                    This bit is trailing edge of the ring indicator detector. TERIi
                                    indicates that RI to the chip has changed from low to a high
                                    level. When TERI is set and the modem status interrupt is
                                    enabled, a modem status interrupt is generated.
1       DSR     RO          DSRn Changed
                                    This bit is change in data set ready indicator. It indicates that
                                    dsrn has changed states since last time it was read by the
                                    CPU.
0       CTS     RO          CTSn Changed
                                    This bit is change in clear to send indicator. It indicates the
                                    ctsn has changed states since last time it was Read by the
                                    CPU.
